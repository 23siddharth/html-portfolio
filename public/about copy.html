<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Just someone blessed with the most devious combination of qualities</p>

<ul>
  <h4><li>Procastinator + Perfectionist</li></h4>
  <p>I can't start working unless the deadline starts to pressurize me. And when it does, thats when my creativity kicks in. I can never convince myself to hand in something imperfect and thats how these qualities get the better of me.</p>
  <h4><li>Creative + Lazy</li></h4>
  <p>I can't put this aspect of mine into words. It's like being blessed with solutions for all problems of the world but also with laziness enough to keep me from implementing them. </p>
</ul>
